# Twitter-validation

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄
In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to gauge the emotions expressed in tweets. Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved:
Steps Involved

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐋𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬
Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and machine learning.

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Employed visualization tools to analyze the distribution and patterns within the dataset, using histograms and bar charts to gain valuable insights.

𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐔𝐧𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧𝐬
Removed irrelevant columns like IDs and unrelated text fields to minimize noise and focus on pertinent data for sentiment analysis.

𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Split text into individual tokens to convert it into a format suitable for analysis and machine learning algorithms.

𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬
Cleaned the text data by eliminating special characters, punctuation, and numbers, retaining only meaningful words.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠
Reduced words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run") to standardize words and reduce data complexity.

𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐥
Removed common words such as "and," "the," "is," etc., to focus on words that significantly contribute to the sentiment.

𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Converted text data into numerical format using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word embeddings, enabling the machine learning model to process the text.

𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧-𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐒𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance, ensuring it can generalize to new data.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Built and trained a machine learning model using algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes to learn patterns and relationships in the text.

𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure effective sentiment prediction and identify areas for improvement.

𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬
The project successfully analyzed and categorized the sentiment of Twitter comments, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends. I am proud of the accuracy and reliability of the model, which demonstrates the power of NLP in understanding social media dynamics.
